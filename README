This git repo contains my projects concerning the TI Launchpad, a development board for the MSP430G2xx line of microprocessors.

Build Instructions
------------------
These projects are built on a computer running OS X 10.7 using the msp430-gcc toolchain.  An OS X package containing a one-shot installer for the toolchain can be found at http://osx-launchpad.blogspot.com/.  A kernel extension to allow the Launchpad to be used on 10.7 is included in this repository. 

Project Listing
---------------

press-button:  My very first microcontroller program.  It toggles the green LED on the Launchpad when a pushbutton is pressed. *sniff* I'm so proud

pwm1:  Playin' With PWM.  The first foray into hardware PWM - the duty cycle is increased by steps when a button is pressed.
